TODO
    - BUG: player turn does not flip correctly along edges
    - BUG: a player choosing to refresh his window causes him to lose status as player (unrecoverable)
    - GAME SETUP: nice if game reset player headings upon new game without requiring refresh button
    - GAME SETUP: must bounce server for new game
    - GAME SETUP: ensure no duplicate alias
    - GAME SETUP: validate player alias when click 'Play' button
    - GAME PLAY: need score
    - GAME PLAY: detect end game conditions
    - GAME PLAY: need a way to indicate who just made a move and where it was
    - NOTIFICATIONS: the game has been won
    - SCENARIO: detect player disconnect

TECHNICAL DEBT:
    - protect against same game url being generated twice (when enable multiple games)
    - the messaging.js contains both game specific logic and messaging logic, should be decoupled
    - reversi.js requires some refactoring --> there's some dead code, mixed formatting
    - messaging is less than optimal --> the entire board is sent on every move made
    - some of the embedding scripting within the games.html is static and can be extracted

LATER FEATURES:
    - allow multiple simultaneous games
    - record and playback of games
    - player chat
    - persistent accounts
    - game clock
    - highlight last square populated
    - forfeit
